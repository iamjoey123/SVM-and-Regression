# SVM-and-Regression
This is the machine learning assignment of implementation of SVM and Regression without using sklearn. 

The main reason of not using sklearn is to further understand the concept behind the SVM and regression, such
as the use of the dual values and the impact of changing slack variable in SVM.

To run the code, simply take the python code file or the jupyter notebook file. However, because the execution
time is excessively long, I put the result and conclusion in the pdf file. Thank you for reading.
